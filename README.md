# N-Puzzle
Solved the N-Puzzle Problem using manhattan & misplaced heuristic.

Had heavy inspiration from my classmates & Professor Eamonn Keogh from UCR.

## Installation

clone the repo

```sh
https://github.com/alexchsieh/N-Puzzle.git
```

## Usage example

run the program

```sh
python3 main.py
```

sample impossible difficulty solution

```sh
Depth of solution: 31
Number of nodes expanded: 21197
Max queue size: 8862
```

## Future Plans
implementing pattern database heuristic such as fringe or static additive, known to be much faster than misplaced/manhattan
